  This profound dance studio located in the heart of Zagreb offers a captivating blend of classical
  and Zumba dances that ignites a passion for movement. As a web designer, I aimed to capture that
  movement through an elegant and classic site. I had the pleasure of collaborating with my
  talented colleague, Tee Huljek, who created a stunning logo that served as the inspiration for
  this exquisite web design.

  Drawing inspiration from the logo redesign, I sought to create a visually immersive experience that
  seamlessly combines the raw energy of the jungle with the refined elegance of classical dances. To
  achieve this, I embraced a palette of earthy and natural muted colors, invoking a sense of connectivity
  and harmony with the natural world. To capture the essence of classical dances, I incorporated design
  elements that exude sophistication and grace.
